# games

This is my repo of games that I've made or tutorials for games that I have
done. These games are mostly going to be toys, unfinished, or tutorials. If a
game ever reaches a point where it warrants it's own repo I'll pull out the
files and the relevant git history and make a new repo for it. Generally games
are going to be sorted in the root of the repo by a directory named after the
framework used for the game, ie LOVE2d games are in the `love` subdirectory.
